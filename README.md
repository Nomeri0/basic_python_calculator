Basic Python Calculator

This is a basic Python calculator that I am building as part of my journey to learn Python syntax through project-based learning.

My goal is to eventually become a Machine Learning Engineer.

Current Features:
The calculator currently supports the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Future Plans:
As I continue to learn more about Python, I will expand the functionality by adding new features and improving the logic.
I plan to finish this project by developing a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make it more interactive.
